##Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

The movtivation for this project being made is because of our course pa1415.

##Installation

##Use cases

We have two use cases one as a costumer and one as admin:

1 Customer:After starting the program press upper right at "Register" fill in the credentials name, last name, email, password then confirm your password. After this a mail will be sent to you, to confirm your registration hit the link that was sent to you(this is in theory now it's just a mock up). Now you are registerd, to login press upper right "Login" enter credentials press the login button in the middle of the screen. Now when you are login enter the fields to search in the start page to search, you have to enter origin, destination and date. Now all the flights that were matching the search will be shown in a tabell, select a flight and then press "Book" in the bottom center. Now you will be shown info about the flight you have selected, you are now able to select how many ticket you would like to book by pressing the arrows under the label Enter Nr Of Passengers (arrow up to increase or arrow down to decrease). Next step is to press Book button  in the bottom center, you will be directed to the pay page where you enter the card number field and press pay.
